# Basementen Aegis

An offline-first, educational cipher encoder/decoder with step-by-step process visualization. Runs as a static web page, an installable PWA, or a native desktop app — everything runs locally, no data ever leaves your machine.

Created by Zethrel.

## ⬇️ Get the app (no setup needed)

**Windows:** [**Download BasementenAegis.exe**](https://github.com/Zethrel/Basementen-Aegis/releases/latest/download/BasementenAegis.exe) — save it anywhere and double-click it. No installation, no Python, no commands. (All versions are on the [releases page](https://github.com/Zethrel/Basementen-Aegis/releases).)

> **First launch:** Windows may warn about an unrecognized publisher (the app is self-signed, not registered with Microsoft). Click **More info → Run anyway**. The app then offers a one-time certificate prompt — accepting it stops the warnings on that PC. Requires the Edge WebView2 runtime, which is built into Windows 10 and 11.

**Or skip the download entirely:** use it in your browser at [zethrel.github.io/Basementen-Aegis](https://zethrel.github.io/Basementen-Aegis/) — on a phone or desktop you can install it as an app from the browser menu, and it keeps working offline.

## Classic Ciphers & Encoding Tools

> **Important:** Every cipher in this application is included for learning, puzzles, and fun between friends. They are classic and historical ciphers — not secure encryption — and should never be relied on to protect sensitive information.

Caesar (English or Danish/Norwegian/Swedish alphabets) · ROT13 · Atbash · Vigenère · Affine · Playfair · Polybius square · Bacon's cipher · Rail Fence · Binary Converter · A1Z26 (English or Scandinavian alphabets) · Binary Reverse (custom) · Elder Futhark runes · Morse code (with Æ/Ø/Å) · Anagram Helper · Caesar Brute Force helper (cracks unknown shifts, English or Scandinavian alphabets)

## Features

- Step-by-step breakdown of every encode/decode operation
- Fully offline — fonts, icons, and QR generation are all bundled locally, nothing is fetched over the network
- Nothing is persisted beyond your interface preferences; no message text is stored
- Installable as a PWA, or run as a standalone desktop app

## Running it

**Web:** open `index.html` directly, or serve the folder with any static file server.

**Desktop (Windows, pre-built):** grab the exe from the [download link above](#%EF%B8%8F-get-the-app-no-setup-needed). Requires the Edge WebView2 runtime (included by default on Windows 10/11).

**Desktop (build it yourself):**
```bash
pip install pywebview pyinstaller
# Windows also needs:
pip install pythonnet
```
```powershell
# One-time (and after certificate expiry): create the 5-year signing
# certificate and export AegisRoot.cer so the build can bundle it
./sign_app.ps1

python -m PyInstaller BasementenAegis.spec --noconfirm

# Sign the freshly built executable with the same certificate
./sign_app.ps1
```
The built app lands in `dist/`. Always build and sign on the same machine — the signing certificate lives in that machine's user certificate store, and a new machine would mint a new identity that users have to re-trust.

To publish a build: bump `APP_VERSION` in `version.js` to match the new release tag (it's shown in the app's footer), rebuild, then attach `dist/BasementenAegis.exe` to a new [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Zethrel/Basementen-Aegis/releases/new) — don't commit the exe. The README's download link always points at the latest release automatically.

## Privacy

Every cipher operation runs entirely client-side. The desktop app's bundled server binds only to `127.0.0.1` and is never exposed to your network.
